All-new site built from zero with daisyui and tailwindcss.

## Creating your own site

First, you need to fork this repository, then clone with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME # Your forked repository
```

You need `node` and `npm` package manager, I suggest you to use `nvm` or any version manager like `pnpm` (of course it does count, but still an package manager anyway).

```bash
npm i # or npm install

npm run dev # For running dev server
```
